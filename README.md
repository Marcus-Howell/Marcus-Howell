# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Marcus

I'm a student from Germany and will finish school in June. For the past six years I have taken part in the robotics competition [First Lego League](https://www.firstlegoleague.org). There I have been responsible for various aspects including physical hardware design, coding (developing both the core logic and also testing the reliability of the robot), doing long term research and project management.
